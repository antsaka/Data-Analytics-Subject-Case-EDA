## Data Analytics Subject - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Case

# The following is a self-exploratory case I conducted using data provided by the instructor for exploration in the fields of machine learning, AI, and data analysis using Python. This case involved performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and trends within the data. Through Python programming, various statistical techniques and visualizations were applied to examine the data's distribution, relationships, and potential outliers. The aim was to uncover meaningful patterns and inform further analysis and decision-making processes based on the data-driven insights obtained from the EDA.
